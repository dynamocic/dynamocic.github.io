## Bikepacking and Saddle Library 

We run a bikepacking and camping equipment library which is open to memberships (Â£50/year). The archive and software is in development but feel free to drop us a message if you're interested in borrowing anything! We have a selection of tents, panniers, matts, saddle bags and much more. We also have a selection of saddles to try if you're struggling with your current one!

We have [a short survey](/survey) to help us find out what items you're interested to see in our equipment library. Please fill it in so we can expand our inventory with the most useful items!

## Our Objects

We are a collective of queer individuals that want to model an alternative cycling industry.

We want to promote equality and diversity in cycling, create a safe and collaborative space for cycling and maintenance activities, facilitate the sharing of knowledge and skills related to cycling.

We want our space to be open to all, but we centre the experiences of those that are traditionally excluded from cycling spaces.

These values are reflected in [our objects](/objects)
