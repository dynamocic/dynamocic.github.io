## Dynamo Glasgow CIC is a new, queer-led cycling and maintenance project in Glasgow.

We are under development. So is this website. But we are so excited to join the Glasgow cycling community.

Follow us on social media for updates!

## Our Objects

We are a collective of queer individuals that want to model an alternative to a cycle industry still largely dominated by men.

We want to promote equality and diversity in cycling, create a safe and collaborative space for cycling and maintenance activities, facilitate the sharing of knowledge and skills related to cycling.

We want our space to be open to all, but we centre the experiences of those that are traditionally excluded from cycling spaces.

These values are reflected in [our objects](/objects)

## Survey

We're in the process of setting up a bicycle workshop space and a membership based equipment library for bike packing and commuting equipment.

We have [a short survey](/survey) to help us gauge interest, demand and pick out the best products to have available for loan. Please follow the link and help us out by filling it in!

## Contact Us

You can contact us at [dynamo.glasgow@pm.me](mailto:dynamo.glasgow@protonmail.com). We look forward to hearing from you!
