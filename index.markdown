## Dynamo Glasgow CIC is a new, queer-led cycling and maintenance project in Glasgow.
## Anna Sylwia

We run a workshop space in the west-end of Glasgow at Unit 21 Hayburn Lane, Glasgow G11 5AT.

Please [email or phone](#contact-us) to enquire.

We are also developing a bikepacking equipment library which will be open to memberships. Watch this space and follow our social media to be the first to hear about it.

## Our Objects

We are a collective of queer individuals that want to model an alternative cycling industry.

We want to promote equality and diversity in cycling, create a safe and collaborative space for cycling and maintenance activities, facilitate the sharing of knowledge and skills related to cycling.

We want our space to be open to all, but we centre the experiences of those that are traditionally excluded from cycling spaces.

These values are reflected in [our objects](/objects)

## Repairs

We are taking on a limited amount of repair work. To book in, [email us at hello@dynamocic.org](mailto:hello@dynamocic.org)

## Survey

We're in the process of setting up a bicycle workshop space and a membership based equipment library for bike packing and commuting equipment.

We have [a short survey](/survey) to help us gauge interest, demand and pick out the best products to have available for loan. Please follow the link and help us out by filling it in!
