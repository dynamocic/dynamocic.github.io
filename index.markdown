## Bikepacking and Saddle Library 

We run a bikepacking and camping equipment library which is open to memberships:
- One-off: £5 - £10 for borrowing up to 5 items, for up to 10 days
- Annual: £50 for for borrowing up to 5 items, for up to 10 days, throughout the year
- Lifetime: £300 for all the perks of an annual membership while making a lasting contribution to support and grow our community

We're developing our system to keep track of available items and manage borrowing, but feel free to drop us a message or come along to the workshop if you want to know what we have. There is a selection of tents, panniers, mats, sleeping bags, saddle bags and much more. We also have a selection of saddles to try if you're struggling with your current one!

To sign up for library membership, please come during our usual workshop opening hours and bring some ID and proof of address with you.

We have [a short survey](/survey) to help us find out what items you're interested to see in our equipment library. Please fill it in so we can expand our inventory with the most useful items!

## Our Objects

We are a collective of queer individuals that want to model an alternative cycling industry.

We want to promote equality and diversity in cycling, create a safe and collaborative space for cycling and maintenance activities, facilitate the sharing of knowledge and skills related to cycling.

We want our space to be open to all, but we centre the experiences of those that are traditionally excluded from cycling spaces.

These values are reflected in [our objects](/objects)
