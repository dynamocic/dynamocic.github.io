## Beginner Wheelbuilding


This course will teach you how to measure your hub and rim, calculate spoke length and build a wheel. Taught by our director and in-house wheelbuilder [Emil Carr-Ross](https://emilcarr.scot), she is passionate about wheelbuilding and using engineering principles to build excellent wheels. 

She will talk to you before the course to help you select your components as well as spokes cut to size ahead of the course.

We can provide almost any wheel parts, including dynamo hubs. Parts will be charged at close-to-retail on top of the course cost. You may provide your own hub and rim, but they must be dropped off with Emil in advance to ensure the correct spokes are ordered.
