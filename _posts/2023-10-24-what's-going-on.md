Dynamo has been ramping up recently. So, what do we have to show for it?

Sadly our friend James at the Glasgow Bike Hive is closing shop, meaning we've had to move as well. But not to worry, we're still in the same place having moved to Unit 21 next door. Our new address is Unit 21 Hayburn Lane and we will be building up the new workshop in the coming months.
The move comes with the benefit of a nice, well-fitted space that just needs furnished. We can't wait to have it up and running!

We've begun buying some of our library equipment thanks to a generous grant from FirstPort.

We've also taken on some Dr Bike contracts - we are now the primary Dr Bike provider for Glasgow School of Art, Glasgow Caledonian University and also providing Dr Bikes for Clyde Cycle Park, Young Movers, Mount Vernon Community Hall among others. This is keeping our director and star mechanic Sylwia very busy and bringing in Social Enterprise income to be reinvested into Dynamo.

Yes, it's an exciting time for us here at Dynamo. I personally am excited to open up our new space and use it for workshops, maintenance sessions and just hanging out. Keep an eye on this website or even better our Instagram page to keep updated.

Yours,
Emil Carr-Ross,
Director
