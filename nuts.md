## Dynamo Glasgow CIC is a nut-free space.

We're committed to keeping our space accessible to everyone and considering the different needs of our members and users of our space. This includes those with severe allergies.

There are members of our community with a severe nut allergy. We ask:

- Please don't bring any open containers of **nuts (tree nuts, peanuts or sesame)**, or products containing nuts, into Dynamo, and check our guidance on any other potential allergens such as dairy.
- Please be extra mindful of hygiene with any equipment, tools or containers that may have come in contact with nuts. Nuts leave an oily residue which even small amounts of can trigger allergies, this must be washed off thoroughly.
- Be mindful of handwashing and personal hygiene.

Thank you for considering others and working with us to keep Dynamo an accessible space.

If you're not sure, have any other questions or suggestions, [please ask](/#contact-us). 

### Thank You
